# OTP

This project features a login and signup page that uses an OTP code sent to the user's email for authentication. In order to enhance security, no password is required.

By eliminating the need for passwords, the login and signup process is both more secure and more convenient for users. This is achieved by relying on the user's email address as the primary means of authentication.

Overall, this project demonstrates a modern and streamlined approach to user authentication and can serve as a useful reference for developers looking to implement similar functionality in their own projects.
